# Description:-
* This is Supply-chain-analysis project.
* This dataset consisits of 24 columnns and 100 records.
* In this project we need to analyse data and give insights to company.
* The data is divided into multiple tables, For addressing various problems and restrictions.

# Methodology:-
* First understand the data, Then divided the dataset into 5 tables. 
* Creating a model based on the tables using primary & foreign keys.
* After uploading the datasets on SQL, we analyzed companies supply chain. 
* I have used various SQL functions & commands like self-join, sub queries, joins,CTE's,Window Functions etc.

# Analysis :-
* What are the top-selling products by revenue?
* Which product categories contribute the most to overall revenue?
* Which products have the highest and lowest stock levels?
* How do lead times impact inventory levels?
* What is the defect rate for each product type, and how does it impact production volumes?
* What are the average shipping times for different shipping carriers?
* Which transportation modes are the most cost-effective for different routes?
* Which suppliers have the shortest and longest lead times?
* Are there any correlations between supplier locations and shipping costs

# Insights:
* Gained insights into product performance, inventory management, and shipping logistics.
* Examined how defect rates can affect production volumes (indirectly linked with assumed supplier categories)


# Recommendations:
* Optimize transportation modes and routes based on a combination of cost and shipping time metrics.
* Adjust weights based on the supply chain strategy, whether cost optimization, speedy delivery, or a balanced approach
